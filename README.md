## What could be improved

Several aspects of this test could be improven with more time and incentives.

- Layout could be greatly improved if designed before implemented
- Several UX/UI aspects could be improven, like for example interactions, transitions, icons and etc
- Dinamic generated code could be moved to hooks and/or factories
- Components could be more fragmented if there was this preference
- Tests could have been implemented
